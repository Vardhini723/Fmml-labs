There are 20640 samples, each with 8 attributes like income of the block, age of the houses per district etc. The task is to predict the cost of the houses per district. We will use the scikit-learn library to load the data and perform some basic data preprocessing and model training. We will also show how to evaluate the model using some common metrics, split the data into training and testing sets, and use cross-validation to get a better estimate of the model's performance."

        "The accuracy of the validation set can be affected by the size of the validation set in the following ways:\n",
        "\n",
        "Increasing the Percentage of the Validation Set:\n",
        "\n",
        "Pros: A larger validation set can provide a more stable and representative estimate of your model's performance because it includes more data points. This can lead to a more accurate assessment of the model's generalization ability.\n",
        "Cons: With a larger validation set, there will be less data left for training the model. This might lead to less effective training and potentially lower performance of the model itself.\n",
        "Reducing the Percentage of the Validation Set:\n",
        "\n",
        "Pros: A smaller validation set allows more data to be used for training, which can improve the model’s ability to learn and generalize from the training data.\n",
        "Cons: A smaller validation set might not be as representative of the overall data distribution, leading to a less reliable estimate of the model's performance. The accuracy on the validation set might become more variable and less indicative of the model's performance on unseen data.\n",
        "In summary, increasing the size of the validation set can lead to a more reliable estimate of model performance, but at the cost of less training data. Conversely, reducing the validation set size gives more data for training but can lead to less reliable performance estimates.\n",

        "2. How does the size of the train and validation set affect how well we can predict the accuracy on the test set using the validation set?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans:- The size of the train and validation sets can significantly impact the ability to predict the accuracy on the test set. Here's how:\n",
        "\n",
        "Train Set Size:\n",
        "\n",
        "Larger Train Set: Generally, a larger training set helps the model learn more about the data distribution, leading to better generalization. This can make the validation set’s accuracy more reliable as a predictor of test set accuracy.\n",
        "Smaller Train Set: With a smaller training set, the model might not learn effectively, leading to poorer generalization. This can cause the validation set accuracy to be less indicative of the test set performance.\n",
        "Validation Set Size:\n",
        "\n",
        "Larger Validation Set: A larger validation set provides a more stable estimate of the model's performance and reduces variance in the accuracy estimate. This means it’s more likely to provide a reliable prediction of test set performance.\n",
        "Smaller Validation Set: A smaller validation set might be less representative of the overall data distribution, leading to higher variance in performance estimates. This can make it harder to predict how well the model will perform on the test set.\n",
